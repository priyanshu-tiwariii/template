# TurboVent Template: A Pre-Configured Monorepo Starter Kit

---

## **The Story Behind TurboVent Template**

As a developer, I’ve often found myself spending **hours** setting up the same stack for every new project—configuring **Next.js**, integrating **Express.js**, setting up **Tailwind CSS**, and ensuring **TypeScript** works seamlessly. It felt like I was reinventing the wheel every single time.  

One day, after yet another frustrating setup session, I thought:  

> *"Why does starting a new project have to be so painful? Why can’t I just focus on building the actual application instead of wasting time on configurations?"*  

That’s when I decided to create **TurboVent**—a **pre-configured monorepo template** that eliminates setup headaches and lets developers jump straight into coding.  

TurboVent is the result of countless hours of refining configurations, fixing compatibility issues, and optimizing workflows. It’s everything I wish I had when starting new projects, and now I’m sharing it with you.
